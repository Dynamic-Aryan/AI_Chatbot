# My Approach to Building an AI-Powered Bot
### By Aryan Pachchigar

Hi, I'm Aryan Pachchigar. Here’s how I would go about building an AI-powered bot that can retrieve information from documents and answer user questions in a smart, useful way.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a bot that can understand a user's question, look through a bunch of uploaded documents, find the most relevant parts, and then generate a good answer — kind of like ChatGPT, but with access to specific documents.

---

## 🧰 What Tech I'd Use

Here’s the stack I’d go with:

- **Python** + **FastAPI** for the backend (fast and clean).
- **OpenAI API** for both generating answers and creating embeddings.
- **LangChain** to tie everything together easily (retrieval + LLM).
- **Pinecone** or **Qdrant** as the vector database to store document chunks.
- Optionally, a **React** or MERN frontend if needed.

---

## 🛠️ How I’d Build It

### Step 1: Document Upload and Chunking  
Take documents (PDF, text, etc.), split them into smaller chunks (like 500 words) with a bit of overlap to preserve context.

### Step 2: Create Embeddings  
Use OpenAI’s Embedding API to convert each chunk into a vector representation.

### Step 3: Store in Vector DB  
Store those vectors in Pinecone or Qdrant, along with metadata like title, file name, etc.

### Step 4: Handle User Queries  
When the user asks something:
- Convert the query into a vector using the same embedding method.
- Search the vector DB to find the most relevant chunks.

### Step 5: Generate Answer  
Use LangChain to combine the retrieved chunks and the user’s question, and pass that to OpenAI’s GPT model to generate a final answer.

## 📈 Optional Features I’d Add

- Authentication system (JWT)
- Admin panel to manage documents
- Query logging for improving the bot later
- Simple caching to speed up repeat queries

---

## 🚀 Deployment

I'd containerize everything with Docker and deploy it on a platform like Render or Railway. FastAPI makes it really easy to scale or move things around later.

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

I think this approach is solid because it uses the power of modern AI, but in a very grounded, real-world way — it only talks based on facts in the documents, not random guesses. I’d love to actually build this with you and improve it as we go!

Thanks for reading!
